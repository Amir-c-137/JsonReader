The "Name Checker" is a simple C++ program that allows you to check if a name exists in a JSON file. It uses a case-insensitive and whitespace-agnostic approach to match names.
Usage

    Compile the program.
    Ensure you have a JSON file named "data.json" with a "people" array containing names.
    Run the program.
    Enter a name when prompted.

The program will inform you whether the provided name is in the JSON data.
